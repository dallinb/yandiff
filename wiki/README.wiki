*xndiff* allows a network administrator or other interested party to easily
monitor one or more networks for changes in port states and running
services.  It achieves this by comparing the results of two nmap scans,
one designated the "baseline", the other "observation".

Both baseline and observation are stored in files generated via nmap’s -oX
switch for XML output.

xndiff is a complete rewrite of ndiff written by James Levine, except
where ndiff used nmap’s "grepable" output, xndiff reads XML output.

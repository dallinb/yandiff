NAME
       xndiff - find differences between two nmap network scans

SYNOPSIS
       xndiff [-f, --format <text | xml>] [-of, --output-file file] [-oh,
       --output-hosts <nmc>] [-op, --output-ports <ofcx>] [-s, --stylesheet
       <file | URL>] --baseline file --observed file

       xndiff --gen-stylesheet file

       xndiff --help | -?

       xndiff --man

       xndiff --version

OPTIONS
       -b file
       --baseline file
               Specifies the nmap results to use as the baseline for the com‐
               parison.

       -f <text | xml>
       --format <text | xml>
               Specifies the output format (text is the default).

       -g file
       --gen-stylesheet file
               Generate an XML stylesheet (XSLT) suitable for use with the
               --stylesheet option.

       -h
       --help  Print a brief help message and exit.

       -m
       --man   Print the manual page and exit.

       -o file
       --observed file
               Specifies the nmap results to use as the "observed results" for
               the comparison.

       -of file
       --output-file file
               Send the output to the specified file.

       -oh <nmc>
       --output-hosts <nmc>
               Specifies which types of hosts to display.  Any combination of
               n, m, or c may be specified, as follows:

               n = new hosts in the "observed" scan.

               m = missing hosts in the "observed" scan.

               c = changed hosts in the "observed" scan.

               The default is to show new, missing and changed hosts.

       -op <ofcx>
       --output-ports <ofcx>
               Specifies which ports to check when outputting changed hosts.
               Open, filtered or closed ports.  Any combination of [ofcx] may
               be specified, as follows:

               o = open ports in the "observed" scan.

               f = filtered ports in the "observed" scan.

               c = closed ports in the "observed" scan.

               x = unfiltered ports in the "observed" scan

               The default is to show all ports.

       -s <file | URL>
       --stylesheet <file | URL>
               Specifies the location of an XML stylesheet to be referred to
               in any XML output.  If the stylesheet specified is not a URL
               and is found to be a non-existent file then it will be gener‐
               ated.  A suitable stylesheet can also be generated using the
               --gen-stylesheet option.

       -V
       --version
               Print the version and exit.

DESCRIPTION
       xndiff is a command line utility (written in Perl) that allows users to
       monitor networks for changes in port states and running services. It
       does this by comparing the XML output of two nmap scans, one designated
       the "baseline", the other the "observation". Alternatively a third XML
       file can be created containing the differences.

EXAMPLES
       To generate a report to screen:

               xndiff --baseline baseline.xml --observed observed.xml

       To generate a stylesheet to file:

               xndiff --gen-stylesheet xndiff.xsl

       To generate a report to an XML file and using the stylesheet generated
       in the previous example:

               xndiff --baseline baseline.xml --observed observed.xml \
                    --format xml --output-file report.xml

HISTORY
       Xndiff is loosely based on ndiff written by James Levine, except where
       ndiff used "grepable" output from nmap, xndiff reads XML output using
       Nmap::Parser.

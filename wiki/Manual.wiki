#summary Manual for xndiff

==NAME==
xndiff - find differences between two nmap network scans

==SYNOPSIS==
 xndiff [--format <text | xml>] [--output-file file] [--output-hosts < nmc >] [--stylesheet <file | URL>] --baseline file --observed file

 xndiff --gen-stylesheet file

 xndiff --help | -?

 xndiff --man

 xndiff --version

==OPTIONS==


 --baseline file
   Specifies the nmap results to use as the baseline for the comparison.


  --format <text | xml>
    Specifies the output format (text is the default).

  --gen-stylesheet file
    Generate an XML stylesheet (XSLT) suitable for use with the --stylesheet option.

  --help
    Print a brief help message and exit.

  --man
    Print the manual page and exit.

  --observed
    Specifies the nmap results to use as the "observed results" for the comparison.

  --output-file
    Send the output to the specified file.

  --output-hosts < nmc  >
    Specifies which types of hosts to display. Any combination of n, m or c may be specified, as follows:
      * n = new hosts in the "observed" scan.
      * m = missing hosts in the "observed" scan.
      * c = changed hosts in the "observed" scan.
    The default is to show new, missing and changed hosts.

  --stylesheet <file | URL>
    Specifies the location of an XML stylesheet to be referred to in any XML output. A suitable stylesheet can be generated using the --gen-stylesheet option.

  --version
    Print the version and exit.

==DESCRIPTION==
 xndiff allows a network administrator or other interested party to easily monitor one or more networks for changes in port states and running services. It achieves this by comparing the results of two nmap scans, one designated the "baseline", the other "observation".

 Both baseline and observation are stored in files generated via nmap's -oX switch for XML output.

==EXAMPLES==
To generate a report to screen:

 xndiff --baseline baseline.xml --observed observed.xml

To generate a stylesheet to file.

 xndiff --gen-stylesheet xndiff.xsl

To generate a report to an XML file and using the stylesheet generated in the previous example.

 xndiff --baseline baseline.xml --observed observed.xml --format xml --output-file report.xml

==HISTORY==
'''xndiff''' is a complete rewrite of ndiff written by James Levine, except where ndiff used nmap's "grepable" output, xndiff reads XML output.

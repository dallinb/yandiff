 yandiff file file

  yandiff --gen-stylesheet file

 yandiff --help | -?

 yandiff --man

 yandiff --version

==OPTIONS==
       -b file

       --baseline file
               Specifies the nmap results to use as the baseline for the comparison.  May be ommitted if the baseline and observed files
               are the only two arguments given.

       -f <text | xml>

       --format <text | xml>
               Specifies the output format (text is the default).

       -g file

       --gen-stylesheet file
               Generate an XML stylesheet (XSLT) suitable for use with the --stylesheet option.

       -h

       --help
        Print a brief help message and exit.

       -m

       --man
        Print the manual page and exit.

       -o file

       --observed file
               Specifies the nmap results to use as the "observed results" for the comparison.  May be ommitted if the baseline and
               observed files are the only two arguments given.

       -of file

       --output-file file
               Send the output to the specified file.

       -oh `<`nmc`>`

       --output-hosts `<`nmc`>`
               Specifies which types of hosts to display.  Any combination of n, m, or c may be specified, as follows:

                n = new hosts in the "observed" scan.
                
                m = missing hosts in the "observed" scan.

                c = changed hosts in the "observed" scan.

                The default is to show new, missing and changed hosts.

       -op `<`ofcx`>`

       --output-ports `<`ofcx`>`
               Specifies which ports to check when outputting changed hosts. Open, filtered or closed ports.  Any combination of `[`ofcx`]` may
               be specified, as follows:

               o = open ports in the "observed" scan.

               f = filtered ports in the "observed" scan.

               c = closed ports in the "observed" scan.

               x = unfiltered ports in the "observed" scan

               The default is to show all ports.

       -s <file | URL>

       --stylesheet <file | URL>
               Specifies the location of an XML stylesheet to be referred to in any XML output.  If the stylesheet specified is not a URL
               and is found to be a non-existent file then it will be generated.  A suitable stylesheet can also be generated using the
               --gen-stylesheet option.

       -V

       --version
               Print the version and exit.



==DESCRIPTION==
'''yandiff''' is a command line utility (written in Perl) that allows users to monitor networks for changes in port states and running services. It does this by comparing the XML output of two nmap scans, one designated the "baseline", the other the "observation". Alternatively a third XML file can be created containing the differences.

==EXAMPLES==
To generate a report to screen:

 yandiff baseline.xml observed.xml

which is equivalent to

 yandiff --baseline baseline.xml --observed observed.xml

To generate a stylesheet to file:

  yandiff --gen-stylesheet yandiff.xsl

To generate a report to an XML file and using the stylesheet generated in the previous example:

 yandiff --baseline baseline.xml --observed observed.xml \ --format xml --output-file report.xml

==HISTORY==
Yandiff is loosely based on ndiff written by James Levine, except where ndiff used "grepable" output from nmap, yandiff reads XML output using Nmap::Parser.

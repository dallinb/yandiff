Dependencies
============

Before you can start, Xndiff required Perl [1], the Nmap::Parser module and
the nmake utility [2]. Xndiff is written in Perl and the Nmap::Parser module
requires nmake during installation. The directories where Perl and nmake are
installed should be in the execution path [3]. When this has been configured
correctly, the Nmap::Parser module needs to be installed by typing the
following command:

	cpan Nmap::Parser

You will be prompted for some yes/no answers and for most users the defaults
are sufficient. This should be the final dependency require to be installed
and you should be able to proceed to install the xndiff utility.

Installation
============

In the example below, the archive has been extracted to C:\xndiff and that is
also the current working directory:
 
	C:\xndiff>perl Build.PL
	C:\xndiff>perl Build build
	C:\xndiff>perl Build test
	C:\xndiff>perl Build install

On a machine running Windows XP this procedure installed the following
files:

	C:\Perl\man\man1\xndiff.1
	C:\Perl\html\bin\xndiff.html
	C:\Perl\site\bin\xndiff
	C:\Perl\site\bin\xndiff.bat

Installing to an alternative location
=====================================
If you do not want to install to the default location, you can specify an
alternative in the first installation command:

        C:\xndiff>perl Build.PL --install_base N:\foobar
	C:\xndiff>perl Build build
	C:\xndiff>perl Build test
	C:\xndiff>perl Build install

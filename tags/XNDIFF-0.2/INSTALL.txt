Dependencies:

	Software:
		make (for installation only)
		perl

	Perl Modules:

		Getopt::Long
		IO::Handle
		Nmap::Parser
		Pod::Usage

To install this software into the default location (/usr/local) do the
following:

	gzip -dc xndiff-0.1.tgz | tar -xof -
	cd xndiff-0.1
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install

To install in an alternative location specify a prefix for where the software
is to be installed.  For example, this set of commands will install the
software in a directory called $HOME/xndiff:

	gzip -dc xndiff-0.1.tgz | tar -xof -
	cd xndiff-0.1
	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=$HOME/xndiff
	make
	make install

If you had specified the alternative prefix (as above) then the following
files would be installed:

	$HOME/xndiff/lib/perl/5.8/perllocal.pod
	$HOME/xndiff/lib/perl/5.8.8/auto/xndiff/.packlist
	$HOME/xndiff/man/man1/xndiff.1p
	$HOME/xndiff/bin/xndiff

Dependencies
============

Before you can start, Xndiff requires Perl [1], the Nmap::Parser module and
the nmake utility [2]. Xndiff is written in Perl and the Nmap::Parser module
requires nmake during installation. The directories where Perl and nmake are
installed should be in the execution path [3]. When this has been configured
correctly, the Nmap::Parser module needs to be installed by typing the
following command:

	cpan Nmap::Parser

You will be prompted for some yes/no answers and for most users the defaults
are sufficient. This should be the final dependency require to be installed
and you should be able to proceed to install the xndiff utility.

17 June 2009 - Release 0.7.  Allows the user to use a slightly less verbose
command line for a quick check (issue27).  Also the output of both text and
XML reports now show what the previous status of a port was (issue21 and
issue24).
 
24 January 2009 - Release 0.6.  Sorted out how the command line worked by
allowing shorted options for the user (issue16), tightened up the logic when
the --version or --gen-stylesheet options were used (issue18) and a
stylesheet is automatically generated if it doesn't exist when using the
--stylesheet option (issue17).

07 January 2009 - Release 0.5.  This release fixed a bug (issue13) which
had unfiltered ports being shown when only filtered ports were
requested.

28 December 2008 - Release 0.4. This release fixed the following bugs:

 * issue9 - Script hangs on Windows.

 It also added the following enhancement:

 * issue1 - The script now allows the user to filter which changed ports should
            be shown.  See the manual for details.

10 December 2008 - Release 0.3. This release implemented a different install
method to move towards a less Linux/Unix dependant release.  Also this script
generates a different (and hopefully improved) XML stylesheet.

29 November 2008 - Release 0.2. This release removed references from the old
ISC license and changed contact details to the Google Code project page.

25 November 2008 - Release 0.1. The initial release after migrating from a
local Subversion repository and from an ISC license to the New BSD to be
compatible with Google Code policy.

Dependencies:

	Software:
		perl

	Perl Modules:

		Getopt::Long
		IO::Handle
		Module::Build	(for installation only)
		Nmap::Parser
		Pod::Usage

To install this software into the default location (/usr/local in Linux) do
the following after decompressing the archive and going to the directory
where it was extracted to:

	perl Build.PL
	perl Build build
	perl Build test
	perl Build install

To install in an alternative location specify a prefix for where the software
is to be installed.  For example, this set of commands will install the
software in a directory called $HOME/yandiff:

	perl Build.PL --install_base $HOME/yandiff
	perl Build build
	perl Build test
	perl Build install

If you had specified the alternative prefix (as above) then the following
files would be installed:

	$HOME/yandiff/man/man1/yandiff.1p
	$HOME/yandiff/bin/yandiff

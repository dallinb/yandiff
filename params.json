{"name":"Yandiff","tagline":"Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/yandiff","body":"Description\r\n===========\r\n\r\nYandiff (previously called Xndiff) is a command line utility (written in Perl)\r\nthat allows users to monitor networks for changes in port states and running\r\nservices. It does this by comparing the XML output of two nmap scans, one\r\ndesignated the \"baseline\", the other the \"observation\". Alternatively a third\r\nXML file can be created containing the differences.\r\n\r\nIt is loosely based on ndiff written by James Levine (circa 2001), except where\r\nndiff used nmap's \"grepable\" output, yandiff reads XML output using\r\nNmap::Parser.\r\n\r\nBuilding a Distribution\r\n=======================\r\n\r\nThis section is only useful if you intend to create a distribution.  It\r\nalso assumes you're using Subversion.\r\n\r\nIn a release branch, ensure that the manifest is up to date, if necessary\r\nrun:\r\n\r\n\tperl Build.PL\r\n\tperl Build manifest\r\n\r\nEnsure that the $VERSION string is set correctly in bin/yandiff (in this\r\nexample it is version 1.3) and make sure that CHANGES.txt has been updated.\r\nThen run the following:\r\n \r\n\tperl Build.PL \r\n\tperl Build disttest\r\n\tperl Build dist\r\n\ttar xzvf yandiff-1.3.tar.gz \r\n\tzip -Dlvr yandiff-1.3.zip yandiff-1.3\r\n\tperl Build realclean\r\n\tsvn status\r\n\r\nIf all has gone well, you should have a zip archive and a gzipped tarball.\r\n","google":"UA-6773548-5","note":"Don't delete this file!
